# Repository Audit — gz_sensors_ouster

_Audit performed on the `develop` branch (the up-to-date line, ~40 commits ahead of
`main`), which contains the multi-backend compute refactor (CUDA / HIP / SYCL / CPU)
behind a common `RayProcessor` interface, the IMU noise model, the CI quality gates
(cppcheck / cpplint / doxygen / pkgxml), and the expanded test suite._

Scope: `src/`, `include/`, `cuda/` (all four backends + dispatch + IMU noise), `test/`,
`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`, `CMakeLists.txt`, `cuda/CMakeLists.txt`, `README.md`,
`package.xml`, `config/`.

## Summary

The architecture is sound: RAII throughout (no raw `new`/`delete`), a correct
render-thread shutdown barrier, race-free triple-buffering of the raw frame, a
well-tested IMU noise model, and a clean backend factory/dispatch with a deprecated
`CudaRayProcessor` alias. The most important problems are in **verification**, not
runtime behaviour: the CI `test` job runs zero tests, and the GPU backends have no
automated coverage. There is also one genuine CPU-vs-GPU output divergence and heavy
copy-paste across the four backends.

## Findings (by severity)

### CRITICAL

**C1 — CI builds and runs zero tests.** The build step runs
`colcon build --cmake-args -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release` with **no `-DBUILD_TESTING=ON`**
(`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`). All tests are gated behind `if(BUILD_TESTING)`
(`CMakeLists.txt`), and nothing in the CMake enables `BUILD_TESTING` (no `include(CTest)`,
no `option(...)`), so it is undefined → false. `colcon test` then finds no test
executables and reports success with 0 tests. Six substantial test suites **never run in
CI** — the `test` job is a green no-op.

### HIGH

**H1 — GPU backends are never exercised; backend selection is untested.** Most suites call
the CPU paths directly (`processCpu()`, `applyImuNoise()`). `test_resample` does construct
`RayProcessor`, but only the default/auto path — which always resolves to CPU in a CPU-only
build — so the dispatch/factory **selection** logic (the `GZ_OUSTER_BACKEND` override, the
CUDA→HIP→SYCL→CPU fallback order, `backendName()`/`usesCpuFallback()`) has no coverage.
CUDA is not even compile-checked in CI (HIP and SYCL get compile-only smoke jobs; CUDA gets
nothing). The CUDA/HIP/SYCL kernels have zero automated coverage of any kind.

**H2 — `ouster-ros` dependency pinned to a floating branch.** CI source-builds
`jcfurey/ouster-ros.git` at branch `ros2`, not a tag/SHA (the comment itself flags this).
A force-push makes CI non-reproducible and can silently break the `PacketWriter` API the
plugin targets.

### MEDIUM

**M1 — Edge-discontinuity gate is written inconsistently across backends (cosmetic, not
behavioural).** The CPU backend gates edge suppression on
`has_noise && edge_discon_threshold > 0` (`cuda/ray_processor_cpu_impl.cpp`); CUDA and HIP
gate on `edge_discon_threshold > 0` alone (`cuda/ray_processor_cuda.cu`,
`cuda/ray_processor_hip.cpp`); SYCL uses a third structure. These look divergent but are in
fact **logically equivalent**: `has_noise = noiseEnabled(p)` already includes
`edge_discon_threshold > 0` (`cuda/backend.hpp`), so `has_noise && edge>0 ≡ edge>0`. No
output divergence exists. The concern is maintainability — the inconsistent spelling
invites a future bug — and is resolved by the M2 deduplication (all backends route through
one shared predicate).

**M2 — Heavy copy-paste across the four backends (~60–86% similar).** Reflectivity scaling
(slope 22), dropout, range-noise, the signal model, and the resampling math are
duplicated nearly verbatim in all four backends. M1 is a direct symptom: a fix in one is
easily missed in the others.

**M3 — README overstates verification.** Performance numbers for HIP/SYCL/CPU are
presented alongside "Measured on NVIDIA RTX … CUDA backend" but are estimates, not
measured. The Tests section implies GPU paths are exercised at integration time, but no
integration tests exist and (per C1) CI runs no tests.

**M4 — GpuRays frame dimensions are trusted, not validated.** `onNewFrame`
(`src/gz_gpu_ouster_lidar_system.cpp`) stores whatever width/height/channels GpuRays
returns without checking against expected `W_`/`H_`. If the cubemap/GpuRays
reconfigures, downstream resampling can over-read.

### LOW

- **L1** — Hard-coded `3.14159265358979` for π in all four backends instead of a named constant.
- **L2** — IMU noise model has no `dt > 0` guard (`cuda/imu_noise.cpp`); `dt = 0` yields an
  infinite white-noise σ silently.
- **L3** — Undocumented magic reflectivity factors (`0.33f`, `0.5f`, `3.0f`) repeated in every backend.
- **L4** — `metadata_published_` / `metadata_pub_count_` are non-atomic; safe only because
  OnRender is single-threaded by Gazebo contract.
- **L5** — `event_mgr_` is a raw pointer assigned from a Gazebo-owned reference; correct but undocumented.
- **L6** — The drain thread holds `publish_mtx_` across the `sleep_until` packet spacing
  (`drainThreadFunc`); a minor lock-hold inefficiency, not a correctness bug.

## Positive notes (no action needed)

- RAII throughout; GPU buffers freed with null checks; all CUDA/HIP calls wrapped in
  error-checking macros.
- Render-thread shutdown barrier (`render_busy_mtx_`) correctly flushes in-flight
  callbacks with proper release/acquire ordering.
- Triple-buffered raw frame minimizes lock hold; pose caching is race-free.
- IMU noise model is correct (√dt discrete-time scaling) and genuinely well-tested.
- Dispatcher factory + deprecated `CudaRayProcessor` alias are clean.
- The 5 metadata JSONs, the SDF example, `package.xml`, and the license headers are consistent.
- The cppcheck / cpplint / doxygen / pkgxml gate configs are sound and well-justified.

## Remediation status
